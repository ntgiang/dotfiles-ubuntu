# Scripts and dotfiles for Ubuntu

Setup script and dotfiles for a new Ubuntu installation. This was created for Ubuntu 16.04 and I will continue to update them as needed.

## What it does

The scripts will setup a complete desktop with the most used (for me) applications and configure the system.

Manual interactions are listed in the "Tweaks" section below.

## Tweaks

* Instead of terminal execute tmux
* Upon selecting a text (terminal, etc.) have it automatically copied into the clipboard using clipit and do:
  * Right click / Preferences / Settings : check: Use Primary selections and Synchronize clipboards
* Create a shortcut for Mongochef (todo)
* Create shortcut for Shutter
  * Go to Settings. Select Keyboard and then shortcusts. Under custom shortcuts add a new entry with:
  * Name: Shutter Selection, Command: shutter -s
  * Then assign shortcut: shift+alt+5
